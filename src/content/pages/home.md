## From Our Table to Yours

Welcome fellow RPG fan. OmniMyth represents a collection of passionate tabletop RPG players and creators who all have one thing in common... They know Brian Ericson.

From game systems, to settings, to adventures, to tools, everything here is human-made by and for people like you.

## What You'll Find Here

### Original Projects

Handmade tabletop rules that may or may not serve your table, made ad-hoc during late night gameplay sessions, lovingly edited, and recompiled into readable, usable content.

### Well-made Products

Please take a look at our offerings. If they have made it to this page, they have made it through several rounds of playtesting, editing, and hours of actual gameplay at the table with friends. If you don't understand something, please reach out and at the very least I can apologize and offer the mindset that went into making the product at the time.

### Free Resources

Access a handful of tools, resources, and projects that I have made for use at my own table. Let me know if you use them at yours!

### Solo Passion

Everything you see here is compiled by a single hobbyist who has enlisted various friends and lovely, skilled, independent artists and designers. All artists retain the rights to their own works to be used as they please in other products and were paid their asking rate for their work.
