# About OmniMyth

---

## Welcome to My Creative Space

OmniMyth is a name that I threw together that felt "right" for the kinds of adventures I was trying to run. It was a play on the idea of ["the monomyth"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey). It represents a handful of adventure settings that I've made for and with my close friends and shared with the rest of the internet in the forms of games and supplements.

## Design Philosophy

### Player-Focused

Every person at the table is a player, including the DM, Game master, Warden, Guide, or whatever you want to call the person who orchestrates your crazy fun. Every player at the table should be having a good time and getting to explore their own unique characters.

### Accessibile

Tabletop gaming should be welcoming to everyone, if you haven't played yet, you probably just haven't found the right group for you. At the end of the day, tabletop games are collaborative storytelling, a tradition that has existed likely before we even had speech.

### Quality Over Quantity

As a solo creator, I'd rather release fewer products that I'm truly proud and has been tested with and by my friends, and made in collaboration with skilled artists than a piece of junk.

### Community Driven

I wouldn't be making any of this if not for my friends, and for you who cares to read it.
