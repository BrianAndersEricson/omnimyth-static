## Project Name: Fables of the Twin Moons

**Status:** Round Three Playtest in Development

### Overview

Taking the lessons learned from our ruleset OmniMyth Fables, and the worldbuilding and design skills learned from the Gaelaeffa Guide to Troika, I've begun working on a setting-specific tabletop game for the setting we use at our own table.

### Core Features

- D20 based system
- A fresh and fast take on TTRPG Combat
- Unique abilities that change the tone of the character you're playing
- Introduces the concept of enemy variants
- Expanded crafting, alchemy, and skills system from OmniMyth
- Built-in lore for our at-home tabletop setting

### Status & Availability

This project is currently stalling a bit between playtests 2 and 3 as I had a lot of feedback on playtest 2 and have not had a chance to redesign some of those elements before moving on to playtest 3.
